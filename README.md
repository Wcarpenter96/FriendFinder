# FriendFinder

a dating app built using Express.js

---

*Note:* This app uses a database hosted on my computer. If the server cannot retrieve the data, it is likely that I am not online. If this is the case, you may still view a demo of the app [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WKaFPVEiKZKuadcJWVI9SnvB-y0kvV9o/view).

Welcome to Friend Finder! To begin, click on ` Go to Survey `. Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question. The app then displays a modal with your matched friend based on the survey. 

Extras: Click on `API friends list` to see all potential friends (along with their answers to the survey!) in JSON format. Click on `GitHub Repo` to see my the FriendFinder repository on Github!

Happy Friend Finding!
