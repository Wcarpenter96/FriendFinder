Welcome to Friend Finder! To begin, click on ` Go to Survey `. Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question. The app then displays a modal with your matched friend based on the survey. 

Extras: Click on `API friends list` to see all potential friends (along with their answers to the survey!) in JSON format. Click on `GitHub Repo` to see the FriendFinder repository on Github!

### Download and Run

Once you have cloned the repository, make sure that you are in the correct directory and run the command 

```

This will create two server instances- the client server will be hosted on Port 3000, 
and the express server will be hosted on Port 3001.
